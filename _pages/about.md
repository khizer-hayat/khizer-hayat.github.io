# About
I am a Research Assistant and PhD graduate in Computing from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, where I completed my PhD in July 2025. My research was supervised by Prof [Jian Yang](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/jian-yang), Assoc Prof [Jia Wu](https://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jiawu/), and Dr [Shan Xue](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/emma-xue), focusing on hypergraph learningâ€”an exciting area of machine learning that analyzes complex, higher-order relationships in data.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from the International Islamic University Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2016 with a focus on Data Mining in Information Networks under the supervision of Dr [Ali Daud](https://ra.ac.ae/en/faculty/bio/prof-ali-daud).

With over 5 years of teaching, academic, and research experience, I am passionate about advancing knowledge in data science and machine learning.

# Research Experience
During my PhD studies, I explored graph data mining, particularly the intricate patterns and dynamics of hypergraphs within real-world graph structures. My research moved beyond traditional pairwise relationships to study multifaceted interactions, developing hypergraph neural networks to capture and analyze these complex relationships.

By designing innovative models, I addressed the limitations of traditional graphs, enabling more robust representations of complex systems. These hypergraph structures provide richer data representations, uncovering subtle patterns and higher-order dependencies often missed in conventional approaches.

This approach advances theoretical understanding and facilitates practical implementations, opening new avenues for solving complex problems in data science. The comprehensive framework allows for more accurate and insightful analyses, empowering data-driven decision-making across sectors such as social network analysis, education, business intelligence, and medical informatics.
